## What is an Array?

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value (i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array).

## Array Operations

Some basic operations associated with arrays are:
- **Insertion**: Adding an element at a specific index.
- **Deletion**: Removing an element at a specific index.
- **Traversal**: Accessing each element of the array sequentially.
- **Searching**: Finding the location of an element in the array.
- **Updating**: Modifying an existing element at a specific index.

## Array in Python

Python provides a built-in data type called `list`, which can be used as a dynamic array. However, Python also supports arrays via the `array` module for working with homogeneous data types (i.e., arrays of the same type).

Here is a quick comparison between `list` and `array` in Python:

- **List**: Can store elements of different data types.
- **Array**: Stores elements of the same data type, requiring the `array` module.

### Example of an Array in Python:

```python
import array

# Create an array of integers
arr = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
